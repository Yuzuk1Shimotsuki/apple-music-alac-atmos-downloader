# Apple Music ALAC / Dolby Atmos Downloader

Original script by Sorrow. Credit to [@zhaarey](https://github.com/zhaarey) and modified by me to include some fixes and improvements.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Install MP4Box before continuing. Ensure it's correctly added to the environment variables.\
> You can do this by entering `apt install wget git golang gpac ffmpeg nano -y` in your terminal.

## New Features

- MP4Box will be called automatically to package EC3 as M4A file.
- Changed the directory structure to `ArtistName\AlbumName`; For Atmos files, its directory structure has changed to `ArtistName\AlbumName [Atmos]` and files are moved into `AM-DL-Atmos downloads`.
- Add support for overall completion status display upon finishing the run.
- Automatically embed cover art and LRC lyrics (requires `media-user-token`).
- Supports `check` with `main`, which can take a text address or API database.
- Add `get-m3u8-from-device` (set to `true`) and set port `adb forward tcp:20020 tcp:20020` to get M3U8 from the emulator.
- Add support templates for folders and files.
- Add support for downloading all albums from an artist: `go run main.go https://music.apple.com/us/artist/taylor-swift/159260351 --all-album`
- Add wrapper integration with its insane decryption speed rate (Supports Linux OS currently)
- Add support for length limitation with `limit-max` (default value of `limit-max` is 200).
- Add support for synchronized and unsynchronized lyrics.
- Add support for decoding files for arm64 platforms.
